        <p>
          I joined Harvey Mudd College's Computer Science department in Fall 2022. I'm currently teaching Principles of Computer Science (CS 60) and have previously taught courses in networking and systems. My research focuses on building systems that enable machine learning on resource-constrained edge devices. Specifically, the systems I build target an improved tradeoff between performance (e.g., accuracy, latency) and resource usage (e.g., energy, cost, memory, bandwidth consumption).
          Before joining HMC, I finished my Ph.D. at UCLA, where I was advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/">Harry Xu</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ravian/">Ravi Netravali</a>. I also served as the head TA, training and evaluating the TAs in the CS department. Prior to UCLA, I was a software engineer at Microsoft for three years, and before that, I received a B.A. in Computer Science from Pomona College in 2014.

        <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Optimizing Machine Learning for Low Power Devices</h2>
          <ul>
            With a team of wonderful undergraduate students (summer '23 pictured), I am working on enabling machine learning on extremely low power devices (in the mW range) that harvest their own energy using solar panels. We are exploring how to build fault tolerance into a system made of inherantly faulty devices! <img src="imgs/summer23.jpg" alt="Research Group Summer '23" width="300" height="300" style="float:right"/></ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Gemel: Model Merging for Memory-Efficient Real-Time Video Analytics at the Edge</h2>
          <ul>
            Through a collaboration with Microsoft Research, we built Gemel, a system for lowering the memory footprint of running a diverse set of deep neural networks (DNNs) on the edge for processing video. We found that typical workloads of DNNs have large groups of layers that appear in multiple models, and keeping just one copy of them could result in significantly lower GPU memory usage. However, merging layers can result in lower accuracy. We designed a search heuristic to decide which layers could be shared while meeting accuracy constraints. Gemel lowered memory usage by up to 60% and will be incorporated into Microsoft's deployed pilot project, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/live-video-analytics/">Rocket for Live Video Analytics</a>.
          </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Reducto: On-Camera Frame Filtering for Resource-Efficient Real-Time Video Analytics</h2>
          <ul>
            I worked with colleagues at UCLA to build a system that filters out unnecessary frames for responding to video analytics queries directly at the camera. Our filtering methods use light-weight frame differencing features, allowing real-time filtering even on cheap cameras. These methods filtered over 50% of frames while meeting accuracy targets, thereby lowering both bandwidth usage and latency by 22%.
